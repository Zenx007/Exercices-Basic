# College C++ Projects

## Description
This repository contains a collection of basic C++ programs developed as part of my college coursework. These projects cover fundamental concepts and introductory programming techniques in C++. ðŸ“š

The main purpose of this repository is to:
* Track my progress in learning C++.
* Serve as a personal archive of the code I've written.
* Provide simple examples for anyone interested in basic C++ concepts.

## Contents
This repository includes various small C++ projects and exercises. Each project/file usually focuses on a specific topic or problem. You might find examples of:
* Basic Input/Output operations
* Control Structures (if-else, loops)
* Functions
* Arrays and Strings
* Simple Data Structures
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) basics (if covered in the coursework)

Feel free to browse the directories to find specific examples. Each program file should contain comments explaining its purpose and logic.
